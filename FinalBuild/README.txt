HOW TO SETUP:
1. Double click 'Unity_Template'
2. Select the following options:
	Screen = 1024 x 768
	Graphic Quality = High
	Check 'Windowed' mode (Important) 

That should be all you need to play!


Difficulty options meaning:
	Free Juic'n: basically unlimited rewind time, recommened for non-gamers
	Normal: ~9 sec rewind with dynamic difficulty, recommened for gamers
	Hard: ~4sec, real gamers only

INPUTS:
The input options on screen (space, arrows, j, k) may be fine for you, but there are some additional ones
available without any config:
	up arrow: jump
	W: jump
	A/D: left/right
	R: rewind
	F: fire

The fire button can be held down, don't both mashing it.
Also this game supports Xbox 360 controllers, hopefully.

TIPS:
Stuck or confused? This game is very early in development so here are some tips:
	- Rewinding time cancels momentum.
	- You can always press jump/rewind to do either action on the death screen, but only one text prompt for either appears.
	- You may run out of time juice to rewind before your death, then just restart the level with jump.
	- You have to wait a second to press jump on the death screen after the prompt comes up. Sorry this was added to prevent people from mashing jump and restarting the level on accident.
	- 'Double Jump' means press jump only at the top of the auto-jump from the spring platform.
	- Ground (even vertical) can be jumped on. Ice cannot.
	- The sixth level is suppose to be nearly impossible, don't worry if you give up.
